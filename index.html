  <p>hile HTML does not require authors to specify <html> element start and ending tags, it is important for authors to do so as it will allow them to specify the lang for the webpage. Providing a lang attribute with a valid language tag according to RFC 5646: Tags for Identifying Languages (also known as BCP 47) on the <html> element will help screen reading technology determine the proper language to announce. The identifying language tag should describe the language used by the majority of the content of the page. Without it, screen readers will typically default to the operating system's set language, which may cause mispronunciations.</p>
